        <p>
            How could it come to this ? <br>
            Long ago, the Elden Ring brought prosperity to the Lands Between. <br>
            But one day it was shattered. The shards, great runes of enormous power fell into the hands of the demigods. <br>
            And although the demigods fought for control, in the end there was no victor.
        </p>

        <p>  
            And so began an era without a Lord… <br>
            Until, from across the Sea of Fog, a Tarnished of no renown arrives at the Lands Between. <br>
            The Tarnished takes their first steps into the world, knowing not what awaits them. <br>
            Greetings traveler, from beyond the fog. I am Melina. I offer you an accord. <br>
            The Tarnished accepts Melina's request, and begins a journey to bring her to the base of the Erdtree. <br>
            As they explore, the Lands Between become known to the Tarnished. And they gain power, shaping themselves in their own way. <br>
            Throughout their journey, they cross paths with unlikely allies. <br>
            Death has left its mark, once again. <br>
            Rise with us, against the Erdtree.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Listen, the Fingers speak. <br>
            And fearsome foes that stand in their way. <br>
            Well, a lowly Tarnished, playing as a Lord. I command thee kneel! <br>
        </p>

        <p>    
            So much power, in the hands of one Tarnished. Growing in strength, with every triumph. <br>
            Who crossed the fog to the Lands Between. To stand before the Elden Ring.<br>
            And become the Elden Lord.<br>
            The Lands Between… are yours to discover.
