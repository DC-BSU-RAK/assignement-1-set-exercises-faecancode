        <p>
            How could it come to this ? <br>
            Long ago, the Elden Ring brought prosperity to the Lands Between. <br>
            But one day it was shattered. The shards, great runes of enormous power fell into the hands of the demigods. <br>
            And although the demigods fought for control, in the end there was no victor.
        </p>

        <p>  
            And so began an era without a Lord… <br>
            Until, from across the Sea of Fog, a Tarnished of no renown arrives at the Lands Between. <br>
            The Tarnished takes their first steps into the world, knowing not what awaits them. <br>
            Greetings traveler, from beyond the fog. I am Melina. I offer you an accord. <br>
            The Tarnished accepts Melina's request, and begins a journey to bring her to the base of the Erdtree. <br>
            As they explore, the Lands Between become known to the Tarnished. And they gain power, shaping themselves in their own way. <br>
            Throughout their journey, they cross paths with unlikely allies. <br>
            Death has left its mark, once again. <br>
            Rise with us, against the Erdtree.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Listen, the Fingers speak. <br>
            And fearsome foes that stand in their way. <br>
            Well, a lowly Tarnished, playing as a Lord. I command thee kneel! <br>
        </p>

        <p>    
            So much power, in the hands of one Tarnished. Growing in strength, with every triumph. <br>
            Who crossed the fog to the Lands Between. To stand before the Elden Ring.<br>
            And become the Elden Lord.<br>
            The Lands Between… are yours to discover.

            <b> Tarnished </b> <br>
            The Tarnished are individuals who lost the grace of the Erdtree and were consequently banished <br>
            from the Lands Between by Queen Marika the Eternal. Following the breaking of the Elden Ring, <br>
            the Tarnished were beckoned by lost grace, fragmentary divine light from the Erdtree, to return.

        </p>

        <p>
           <b> Melina </b> <br>
            Melina is the deuteragonist of Elden Ring. She is a mysterious, spectral woman who offers <br>

        <h2 id="review" class="subheading"> Reviews </h2>
        <p>
            "Elden Ring is a masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling. <br>
            Elden Ring doesn't impose any particular playstyle or route on you. <br>
            You are completely free to do what you want to from the very start of the game." <br>
            It is truly refreshing to feel this sense of freedom in choice and exploration in any open world game.
        </p>

        <p> 
            "This game is my absolute favorite soulslike game and is one of my favorite RPG games <br>
            along side the Witcher 3 and breath of the wild." Like all souls like games the combat is extremely <br>
            challenging but unlike others if you get stuck on a boss that hinders your game progression you can <br>
            simply go off and explore more of the map and simply come back later.
        </p>

        <p>
            this game is the most beautiful game ever. The world building, art style and use of beautiful buildings
            aswell as sheer size of the map form together a beautiful concoction for players to navigate. <br>
            "If you love video games, you have to give Elden Ring a shot. It is a emotion filled journey <br>
            that every fan of gaming needs in their life!"
        </p>
